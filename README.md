**_I am currently working on a complete overhaul of the theme, in order to make it work with obsidian v1.0.0. This could take quite some time, as I have quite a full week, so please be patient; it will be worth it._**

## Description

This is going to be a dark theme with a 3D look, which uses your chosen accent color. It will have many extra functions (if you use the below mentioned snippets) and is highly configurable via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.

## Planed Extra Features (Not yet working due to the obsidian v1.0.0 update)

- Custom workspace background
- Translucent panels (Only useful if a custom background is used)
- Active line effect
- Hover over line effect
- Custom callouts
  - Heading callout (callout tag: "h") such that whole sections under the heading can be folded via callout fold arrows
  - MOC callout (callout tag: "moc") such that a wiki like, left aligned, moc can be created
  - Controls callout (callout tag: "ctrl") for use as a ctrl-buttons header (Work in progress)
- Exportmode (Work in progress)
